# GridGod MT5 Expert Advisor

This is an Expert Advisor (EA) code for MetaTrader 5 platform developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The GridGod EA is designed to trade in the H1 time frame and aims to simplify forex trading using a grid strategy.

### How it works

The GridGod EA uses a grid strategy to place buy and sell orders based on the current market price. Here is a breakdown of the key steps involved:

1. Import necessary libraries and define variables: The code starts by importing the required libraries and defining the input variables such as LotSize, GridStep, TakeProfit, and StopLoss.

2. Initialize the Expert Advisor (OnInit): In the OnInit function, the expert magic number is set for identification purposes.

3. Start trading (OnTick): The OnTick function is called on each tick of the market. It retrieves the current price and calculates various entry and exit levels for buy and sell orders.

4. Check total number of orders: The code checks the total number of open orders using the PositionsTotal function.

5. Open buy or sell order: If there are no open orders, the code checks if the current price is below the entry price to open a buy order or above the entry price to open a sell order.

6. Modify existing orders: If there are open orders, the code checks if the entry price has changed. If it has, the code modifies the existing orders to match the new entry price.

7. Close and open new orders: If the price reaches the last sell price and the current Ask price is above the entry price, the code closes the sell order and opens a new buy order. Similarly, if the price reaches the last buy price and the current Bid price is below the entry price, the code closes the buy order and opens a new sell order.

8. Stop trading (OnDeinit): The OnDeinit function is called when the EA is stopped or removed from the chart. In this code, it closes all open positions.
